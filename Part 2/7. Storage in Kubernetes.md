# Chapter 7: Storage in Kubernetes

Applications often need to persist data beyond the lifecycle of a single Pod. Kubernetes provides a powerful and flexible storage subsystem built around Volumes, PersistentVolumes (PV), PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC), and StorageClasses. This chapter explores these concepts and introduces StatefulSets, a workload controller designed for stateful applications like databases.

## Volumes Revisited: Ephemeral and Persistent

As discussed in Chapter 3, a **Volume** is a directory accessible to containers within a Pod. Its lifecycle depends on the volume type:

*   **Ephemeral Volumes:** Tied to the Pod lifecycle. Data is lost when the Pod is deleted.
    *   `emptyDir`: A simple empty directory created when the Pod starts, deleted when the Pod ends. Useful for scratch space or sharing files between containers in the *same* Pod.
    *   `configMap`, `secret`: Mount configuration data or secrets as read-only files or environment variables. Data comes from Kubernetes API objects.
    *   `downwardAPI`: Exposes Pod metadata (labels, annotations, resource limits, etc.) as files.
*   **Persistent Volumes:** Designed to outlive Pods. Data remains even if the Pod using it is deleted or rescheduled. These rely on network or external storage solutions.
    *   `hostPath`: Mounts a directory from the *host node's* filesystem. **Use with extreme caution!** Data is tied to a specific node, making Pods non-portable. Can pose security risks. Suitable only for specific system-level Pods (like DaemonSets needing node access) or single-node development clusters.
    *   Cloud Provider Volumes: `awsElasticBlockStore`, `gcePersistentDisk`, `azureDisk`, `azureFile`. Integrate directly with cloud storage services.
    *   Network Filesystems: `nfs`, `cephfs`, `glusterfs`, `iscsi`. Connect to existing network storage infrastructure.
    *   **`persistentVolumeClaim`:** The *abstraction* Pods use to request persistent storage. This is the most common and recommended way for applications to consume persistent storage.

## Persistent Volumes (PV)

A **PersistentVolume (PV)** represents a piece of storage in the cluster, provisioned by an administrator or dynamically using StorageClasses. It's a cluster-level resource, like a Node.

*   **Purpose:** To abstract the details of the underlying storage infrastructure (NFS, iSCSI, cloud provider storage, etc.) from application developers/users.
*   **Lifecycle:** Independent of any Pod. The PV object exists until explicitly deleted.
*   **Key Attributes:**
    *   `capacity`: The amount of storage (e.g., `5Gi`, `100Mi`).
    *   `volumeMode`: Filesystem (default) or Block.
    *   `accessModes`: Defines how the volume can be mounted by nodes. Crucial for matching with PVCs.
        *   `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO): Mountable as read-write by a *single* node. (Most common for block storage like EBS, GCE PD).
        *   `ReadOnlyMany` (ROX): Mountable as read-only by *many* nodes.
        *   `ReadWriteMany` (RWX): Mountable as read-write by *many* nodes. (Requires shared filesystem like NFS, CephFS, GlusterFS).
        *   `ReadWriteOncePod` (RWOP): Mountable as read-write by a *single Pod*. (Newer feature, requires specific CSI drivers).
    *   `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`: What happens to the underlying storage when the PV is released (i.e., the bound PVC is deleted).
        *   `Retain` (Safest Default): Keeps the volume and data. Requires manual cleanup by the administrator.
        *   `Delete`: Deletes the underlying storage (e.g., deletes the EBS volume or GCE disk). Use carefully!
        *   `Recycle` (Deprecated): Performs basic scrub (`rm -rf /thevolume/*`). Not recommended.
    *   `storageClassName`: Links the PV to a StorageClass (for dynamic provisioning or specific matching).
    *   `nodeAffinity`: Restricts which nodes can access this PV (required for local storage).
    *   Source Definition: Specifies the actual storage backend (e.g., `nfs`, `awsElasticBlockStore`).

*Example PV Definition (Manual Provisioning - NFS):*
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-pv-01
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany # NFS supports RWX
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain # Keep data on PVC deletion
  storageClassName: slow-nfs # Optional class name
  mountOptions: # NFS specific mount options
    - hard
    - nfsvers=4.1
  nfs: # NFS source definition
    path: /exports/data01 # Path on the NFS server
    server: 192.168.1.100 # IP of the NFS server
```

## Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

A **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** is a request for storage by a user/Pod. It consumes PV resources, similar to how a Pod consumes Node resources.

*   **Purpose:** Allows users/applications to request storage with specific requirements (size, access mode) without needing to know the underlying storage details.
*   **Lifecycle:** Lives within a Namespace. When a Pod requests storage via a PVC, Kubernetes tries to find a matching PV (or dynamically provision one) and **binds** the PVC to the PV. The PV is then considered "Bound" and cannot be bound by another PVC. When the PVC is deleted, the PV is "Released" and becomes available again (subject to the reclaim policy).
*   **Key Attributes:**
    *   `accessModes`: Requested access modes (must be a subset of the PV's modes).
    *   `resources.requests.storage`: Minimum required storage size. Kubernetes will find a PV with at least this capacity.
    *   `storageClassName`: Optionally requests a specific StorageClass. If omitted and a default StorageClass exists, that will be used for dynamic provisioning.
    *   `volumeName`: Optionally requests binding to a *specific* PV by name (usually only for pre-bound scenarios).
    *   `selector`: Optionally uses labels to select specific PVs.

*Example PVC Definition:*
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-app-pvc
  # namespace: my-app-ns # PVCs are namespaced
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce # Request RWO access
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Request at least 1Gi
  # storageClassName: fast-ssd # Optional: Request a specific class
```

**Using a PVC in a Pod:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod-with-storage
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts: # Mount the volume into the container
    - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html # Path inside container
      name: my-storage-volume # Must match volume name below
  volumes: # Define the volume source for the Pod
  - name: my-storage-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim: # Specify the source is a PVC
      claimName: my-app-pvc # Name of the PVC created above
```

## Storage Classes for Dynamic Provisioning

Manually creating PVs for every storage request can be cumbersome. **StorageClasses** allow administrators to define different "classes" of storage and enable **dynamic provisioning**.

*   **Purpose:** Define types of storage (e.g., "ssd", "hdd", "backup") and automate PV creation when a PVC requests that class.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  Admin creates a StorageClass object, specifying a `provisioner` (e.g., `kubernetes.io/aws-ebs`, `kubernetes.io/gce-pd`, `csi-driver-name`) and `parameters` specific to that provisioner (e.g., disk type, encryption).
    2.  A user creates a PVC specifying the `storageClassName`.
    3.  The provisioner (watching for PVCs requesting its class) automatically creates a suitable PV and the underlying storage resource (e.g., an EBS volume).
    4.  Kubernetes binds the PVC to the newly created PV.
*   **Default StorageClass:** An administrator can mark one StorageClass as the default for the cluster. If a PVC is created without specifying a `storageClassName`, the default StorageClass will be used for dynamic provisioning.

*Example StorageClass (AWS EBS GP3):*
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: aws-gp3-standard
  # annotations:
  #   storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true" # Make this the default
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com # AWS EBS CSI driver provisioner
parameters:
  type: gp3 # EBS volume type
  fsType: ext4 # Filesystem type
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer # Delay binding until a Pod uses the PVC (recommended)
reclaimPolicy: Delete # Or Retain - Delete is common for dynamic PVs
allowVolumeExpansion: true # Allow resizing PVCs later
```

**Managing Storage Classes:**
```bash
kubectl get sc # List StorageClasses
kubectl describe sc <storageclass-name>
```

## StatefulSets for Stateful Applications

Deployments are great for stateless applications where any Pod replica is interchangeable. However, applications like databases, message queues, or key-value stores often require:

*   **Stable, unique network identifiers:** Pods need predictable DNS names to discover peers.
*   **Stable, persistent storage:** Each Pod instance needs its own persistent volume that follows it even if rescheduled.
*   **Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling:** Pods should be created/updated/deleted one at a time in a specific order.
*   **Ordered, graceful termination:** Pods should be terminated in reverse order.

**StatefulSets** provide these guarantees.

*   **Purpose:** Manage the deployment and scaling of stateful applications.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Stable Network ID:** Pods get a predictable hostname: `<statefulset-name>-<ordinal-index>` (e.g., `web-0`, `web-1`). A Headless Service is typically used with StatefulSets to provide DNS records for these stable names.
    *   **Stable Storage:** Uses a `volumeClaimTemplates` section to automatically create a unique PVC for each Pod replica. The PVC name is `<template-name>-<statefulset-name>-<ordinal-index>` (e.g., `data-web-0`, `data-web-1`). When a Pod is rescheduled, it reattaches to its original PVC.
    *   **Ordered Deployment/Scaling:** Pods are created sequentially (0, 1, 2...). Updates (`RollingUpdate` or `OnDelete`) and scaling down also happen in order (N-1, N-2,... 0).

*Example StatefulSet (`web-statefulset.yaml`):*
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service # Headless Service for stable network IDs
metadata:
  name: nginx-headless
spec:
  clusterIP: None # Makes it headless
  selector:
    app: nginx-sts # Selects pods managed by the StatefulSet
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: web
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "nginx-headless" # Associate with the headless service
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-sts # Must match template labels
  template: # Pod template
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-sts
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www-storage # Mount the volume created from template
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates: # Template for creating PVCs per Pod
  - metadata:
      name: www-storage # Name used in volumeMounts
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      # storageClassName: "your-storage-class" # Specify if needed
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

**Managing StatefulSets:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f web-statefulset.yaml
kubectl get statefulset web # or sts
kubectl describe sts web
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx-sts # See pods web-0, web-1, web-2
kubectl get pvc -l app=nginx-sts # See PVCs www-storage-web-0, www-storage-web-1, ...
# Scale (happens sequentially)
kubectl scale sts web --replicas=5
kubectl scale sts web --replicas=3 # Scales down 4, then 3
kubectl delete sts web # Deletes pods in reverse order (2, 1, 0)
kubectl delete service nginx-headless
# Note: PVCs are NOT deleted by default when StatefulSet is deleted! Manual cleanup needed.
kubectl delete pvc -l app=nginx-sts
```

## Lab: Deploy a Database with Persistent Storage

This lab deploys a simple PostgreSQL database using a StatefulSet, ensuring it has stable network identity and persistent storage via a PVC created from a volumeClaimTemplate.

**Prerequisites:**
*   `kubectl` connected to a running Kubernetes cluster.
*   A default StorageClass configured, or modify the YAML to specify an available one. Check with `kubectl get sc`. (Minikube often has a `standard` default StorageClass).

**Steps:**

1.  **Create StatefulSet and Service Manifest:**
    Save as `postgres-statefulset.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service # Headless service for DNS discovery
    metadata:
      name: postgres-headless
    spec:
      clusterIP: None
      selector:
        app: postgres-sts
      ports:
      - port: 5432
        name: postgres
    ---
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: StatefulSet
    metadata:
      name: postgres-db
    spec:
      serviceName: "postgres-headless"
      replicas: 1 # Start with a single instance database
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: postgres-sts
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: postgres-sts
        spec:
          terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
          containers:
          - name: postgres
            image: postgres:13 # Use official PostgreSQL image
            ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
              name: postgres
            env: # Set required environment variables for postgres image
            - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
              value: "mysecretpassword" # Use Secrets in production!
            - name: PGDATA # Tell postgres where the data directory is mounted
              value: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
            volumeMounts:
            - name: postgres-data # Mount the persistent volume
              mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
            readinessProbe: # Check if postgres is ready to accept connections
              exec:
                command: ["psql", "-U", "postgres", "-c", "SELECT 1"]
              initialDelaySeconds: 10
              periodSeconds: 5
              timeoutSeconds: 2
      volumeClaimTemplates:
      - metadata:
          name: postgres-data # Name used in volumeMounts
        spec:
          accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 2Gi # Request 2Gi storage
          # storageClassName: standard # Uncomment/change if needed
    ```

2.  **Deploy PostgreSQL:**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f postgres-statefulset.yaml
    ```

3.  **Check Deployment Status:**
    Wait for the Pod and PVC to be created and bound:
    ```bash
    kubectl get statefulset postgres-db
    kubectl get pods -l app=postgres-sts -w # Wait for postgres-db-0 to be Running (1/1)
    kubectl get pvc -l app=postgres-sts # Check PVC status (should be Bound)
    kubectl get pv # See the underlying PV that got bound/created
    ```

4.  **Connect to the Database (from another Pod):**
    Deploy a temporary client Pod to test the connection using the stable DNS name:
    ```bash
    kubectl run pg-client --rm -it --image=postgres:13 -- bash
    # Inside the pg-client pod's shell:
    # apt-get update && apt-get install -y iputils-ping dnsutils
    # Test DNS resolution:
    # nslookup postgres-db-0.postgres-headless.default.svc.cluster.local
    # Connect using psql (use the password from the manifest):
    # psql -h postgres-db-0.postgres-headless -U postgres -c '\l'
    # Password: mysecretpassword
    # (You should see the default postgres databases listed)
    # exit # Exit the client pod (it will be auto-deleted due to --rm)
    ```

5.  **Simulate Pod Deletion and Recreation:**
    Delete the Pod managed by the StatefulSet:
    ```bash
    kubectl delete pod postgres-db-0
    ```
    Watch the StatefulSet recreate the Pod:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -l app=postgres-sts -w
    # A new postgres-db-0 pod will be created.
    ```
    Once the new Pod is running, connect again using the `pg-client` method above. Any data you created would still be there because the new Pod reattached to the *same* PVC (`postgres-data-postgres-db-0`).

6.  **Clean Up:**
    ```bash
    kubectl delete statefulset postgres-db
    kubectl delete service postgres-headless
    # IMPORTANT: Delete the PVC manually to release/delete the underlying PV!
    kubectl delete pvc postgres-data-postgres-db-0
    ```

**Congratulations!** You have deployed a stateful application (PostgreSQL) using a StatefulSet, leveraging a headless Service for stable network identity and a PersistentVolumeClaim template for stable, persistent storage. This is a fundamental pattern for running databases and other stateful workloads in Kubernetes.
