# Chapter 8: Introduction to Terraform

Welcome to Part 3! So far, we've focused on Kubernetes itself – its architecture, core objects, and how to manage applications within a cluster. Now, we shift our attention to the infrastructure *underneath* Kubernetes. How do we create and manage the virtual machines, networks, load balancers, and even the Kubernetes cluster itself in a reliable and repeatable way? This is where **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** comes in, and **Terraform** is a leading tool in this space.

## What is Terraform? Why Use It with Kubernetes?

**Terraform** is an open-source **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources using a high-level, declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), although it also supports JSON.

**What is Infrastructure as Code?**

Instead of manually clicking through web consoles or running sequences of CLI commands to set up servers, networks, databases, etc., IaC involves writing code (configuration files) to define your infrastructure. This code can then be version-controlled (like application code), reviewed, tested, and executed automatically to provision and manage your infrastructure.

**Key Benefits of IaC (and Terraform):**

*   **Automation:** Reduces manual effort and the potential for human error in provisioning and managing infrastructure.
*   **Repeatability & Consistency:** Ensures that the same infrastructure setup can be deployed consistently across different environments (dev, staging, prod) or regions.
*   **Version Control:** Infrastructure definitions can be stored in Git, providing history, collaboration, and rollback capabilities.
*   **Modularity & Reusability:** Break down infrastructure into reusable components (Modules in Terraform).
*   **Documentation:** The code itself serves as documentation for the infrastructure setup.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Terraform tracks the resources it creates and can update or destroy them safely.

**Why Use Terraform with Kubernetes?**

While Kubernetes excels at orchestrating containers *within* a cluster, Terraform excels at provisioning and managing the cluster *itself* and its surrounding cloud resources. Common use cases include:

1.  **Provisioning Kubernetes Clusters:** Creating managed clusters (like AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS) or self-managed clusters on cloud VMs or bare metal.
2.  **Managing Cloud Resources:** Setting up the necessary cloud infrastructure *around* Kubernetes, such as:
    *   VPCs, subnets, security groups, NAT gateways
    *   Load balancers (that might front an Ingress controller)
    *   Managed databases (RDS, Cloud SQL)
    *   IAM roles and policies for cluster components
    *   DNS records
3.  **Managing Kubernetes Resources (Optional):** Terraform also has providers for Kubernetes (and Helm), allowing you to potentially manage Kubernetes objects like Deployments, Services, or Namespaces using Terraform HCL. This is often debated vs. using tools like `kubectl apply` or GitOps tools (like ArgoCD, Flux), but it's an option.

Terraform provides a unified workflow to manage both the core Kubernetes cluster infrastructure and the application infrastructure running inside it, if desired.

## Terraform vs. Other IaC Tools

Terraform is not the only IaC tool. Here's a brief comparison:

*   **Cloud Provider Native Tools (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates, Google Cloud Deployment Manager):**
    *   **Pros:** Deep integration with the specific cloud provider, often first access to new features.
    *   **Cons:** **Vendor Lock-in.** Configurations are specific to one cloud and cannot be easily used elsewhere. Syntax (often JSON/YAML) can be verbose. State management might be less flexible than Terraform's.
*   **Pulumi:**
    *   **Pros:** Uses general-purpose programming languages (Python, Go, TypeScript, C#, etc.) to define infrastructure, allowing use of loops, conditionals, classes, and existing libraries. Can manage resources across multiple clouds and services, similar to Terraform.
    *   **Cons:** Requires programming language knowledge. State management is typically tied to the Pulumi service (though self-hosted options exist). Smaller community than Terraform (but growing).
*   **Ansible, Chef, Puppet:**
    *   These are primarily **Configuration Management** tools, focused on configuring software *on* existing servers (installing packages, managing files, starting services). While they *can* provision infrastructure (especially Ansible), it's often less declarative and robust than Terraform's approach for pure provisioning. They often complement Terraform – Terraform provisions the base infrastructure, and Ansible/Chef/Puppet configure the software on the VMs.

**Why Choose Terraform?**

*   **Cloud Agnostic:** Supports numerous providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, Datadog, GitHub, many more), allowing management of diverse infrastructure from one tool.
*   **Declarative Language (HCL):** Relatively easy to learn, focuses on *what* infrastructure you want, not *how* to create it step-by-step.
*   **Large Community & Ecosystem:** Extensive documentation, community modules, and support.
*   **Mature State Management:** Provides robust mechanisms for tracking resource state.
*   **Planning Step:** `terraform plan` shows exactly what changes will be made before applying them, preventing surprises.

## Installing Terraform and Setting Up Providers

**Installation:**

Terraform is distributed as a single binary.

1.  **Download:** Go to the official Terraform Downloads page: [https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
2.  **Select Your OS:** Download the appropriate package for your operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux).
3.  **Install:** Follow the instructions for your OS. Typically involves unzipping the package and placing the `terraform` binary in a directory included in your system's `PATH`.
4.  **Verify:** Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    terraform version
    # Should output the installed Terraform version
    ```

**Providers:**

Terraform interacts with different platforms (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.) via **Providers**. Providers are plugins that understand the API interactions needed to manage resources on that platform.

*   You declare required providers in your Terraform configuration.
*   When you run `terraform init`, Terraform downloads the necessary provider plugins.

*Example Provider Declaration (in a `.tf` file):*
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    # Using the Docker provider for local examples
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker" # Official source path on Terraform Registry
      version = "~> 2.15"            # Specify a version constraint
    }
    # Example for AWS provider
    # aws = {
    #   source  = "hashicorp/aws"
    #   version = "~> 4.0"
    # }
  }
}

# Configure the Docker provider (often optional for local Docker Desktop)
provider "docker" {
  # host = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock" # Usually auto-detected
}

# Configure the AWS provider (requires credentials)
# provider "aws" {
#   region = "us-west-2"
#   # Credentials typically configured via environment variables, shared files, or IAM roles
# }
```

## Writing Your First Terraform Configuration

Let's create a simple configuration to manage a local Docker container using the Docker provider.

1.  **Create a Directory:** Make a new directory for your project, e.g., `terraform-docker-example`.
2.  **Create `main.tf`:** Inside the directory, create a file named `main.tf` with the following content:

    ```hcl
    # main.tf

    terraform {
      required_providers {
        docker = {
          source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
          version = "~> 2.15" # Use a recent version
        }
      }
    }

    provider "docker" {
      # Configuration options can be added here if needed,
      # but defaults often work for local Docker Desktop.
    }

    # Define a Docker Image resource
    # This tells Terraform to ensure the 'nginx:latest' image is pulled locally.
    resource "docker_image" "nginx_image" {
      name = "nginx:1.21" # Use a specific version
      keep_locally = true # Keep the image even after Terraform destroys resources that use it
    }

    # Define a Docker Container resource
    # This tells Terraform to create and manage an Nginx container.
    resource "docker_container" "nginx_container" {
      # Use the image managed by the docker_image resource above
      image = docker_image.nginx_image.name # Reference the image name

      name  = "terraform-nginx-example" # Name for the container
      ports {
        internal = 80 # Container port
        external = 8088 # Host port to map to
      }
    }
    ```

**Explanation:**

*   `terraform {}` block: Declares required providers.
*   `provider "docker" {}` block: Configures the Docker provider (empty here, using defaults).
*   `resource "<provider>_<type>" "<name>" {}` block: Defines a resource to be managed by Terraform.
    *   `docker_image` "nginx_image": Represents the Nginx Docker image. Terraform will ensure this image exists locally.
    *   `docker_container` "nginx_container": Represents the Nginx Docker container.
    *   `image = docker_image.nginx_image.name`: This is an **interpolation**. It tells Terraform to use the `name` attribute (which includes the tag) of the `docker_image` resource named `nginx_image` as the image for this container. This creates a dependency.
    *   `ports {}`: Defines the port mapping.

## Lab: Provision a Local Docker Container with Terraform

This lab uses the `main.tf` file created above to demonstrate the basic Terraform workflow.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Terraform installed.
*   Docker installed and running (e.g., Docker Desktop).

**Steps:**

1.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    Open your terminal and `cd` into the `terraform-docker-example` directory containing `main.tf`.

2.  **Initialize Terraform:**
    This command downloads the Docker provider plugin defined in your configuration.
    ```bash
    terraform init
    # Output: Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    ```
    You'll see a `.terraform` directory created, containing the downloaded provider.

3.  **Plan the Changes:**
    This command shows you what Terraform *would* do if you applied the configuration. It's a dry run.
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    # Output: Shows a plan to add 2 resources:
    # + resource "docker_container" "nginx_container" { ... }
    # + resource "docker_image" "nginx_image" { ... }
    # Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
    ```
    Review the plan carefully.

4.  **Apply the Changes:**
    This command executes the actions proposed in the plan.
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    Terraform will show the plan again and ask for confirmation. Type `yes` and press Enter.
    ```
    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.
      Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

      Enter a value: yes
    ```
    Terraform will now pull the Nginx image (if you don't have it) and start the container.
    ```
    # Output may include:
    # docker_image.nginx_image: Creating...
    # docker_image.nginx_image: Creation complete after Xs [id=sha256:...]
    # docker_container.nginx_container: Creating...
    # docker_container.nginx_container: Creation complete after Ys [id=...]
    # Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
    ```

5.  **Verify the Container:**
    *   Check Docker: `docker ps` (You should see the `terraform-nginx-example` container running).
    *   Access Nginx: Open `http://localhost:8088` in your browser. You should see the "Welcome to nginx!" page.

6.  **Inspect Terraform State:**
    Terraform has created a `terraform.tfstate` file. This JSON file records the resources Terraform manages and their current state. **Do not edit this file manually!**
    ```bash
    # Optional: View managed resources
    terraform state list
    # Output:
    # docker_container.nginx_container
    # docker_image.nginx_image
    ```

7.  **Destroy the Resources:**
    This command removes the resources managed by this Terraform configuration.
    ```bash
    terraform destroy
    ```
    Terraform will show a plan to destroy the resources and ask for confirmation. Type `yes` and press Enter.
    ```
    # Output:
    # docker_container.nginx_container: Destroying...
    # docker_container.nginx_container: Destruction complete after Xs
    # docker_image.nginx_image: Destroying... (Note: only removes Terraform's tracking unless keep_locally=false)
    # docker_image.nginx_image: Destruction complete after Ys
    # Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
    ```
    Verify with `docker ps` - the container should be gone. The image might remain locally due to `keep_locally = true`.

**Congratulations!** You've successfully used Terraform to define, provision, and destroy infrastructure (a Docker container) using the basic `init`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy` workflow. In the next chapter, we'll explore more Terraform concepts relevant to managing cloud infrastructure for Kubernetes.
