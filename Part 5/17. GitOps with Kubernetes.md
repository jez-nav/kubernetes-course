# Chapter 17: GitOps with Kubernetes

We've explored deploying applications using `kubectl apply` and managing infrastructure with Terraform. However, as environments scale and teams grow, maintaining consistency and managing deployments reliably becomes challenging. **GitOps** is an operational paradigm that addresses these challenges by using Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application definitions.

## Introduction to GitOps: Principles and Tools

**What is GitOps?**

GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Delivery for cloud-native applications. It focuses on a developer-centric experience where developers use familiar tools, primarily Git, to manage both application and infrastructure deployments. The core idea is to have a Git repository containing declarative descriptions of the desired production state, and an automated process that ensures the production environment matches the state defined in the repository.

**Core Principles of GitOps:**

1.  **Declarative:** The entire desired state of the system (applications, configuration, infrastructure) must be described declaratively. Kubernetes manifests (YAML) and Terraform configurations (HCL) are inherently declarative.
2.  **Versioned and Immutable:** The desired state is stored in a Git repository, making it versioned, immutable, and providing a complete audit trail of changes. Git is the single source of truth.
3.  **Approved Automatically:** Changes to the desired state, once approved and merged into the target branch in Git, are automatically applied to the system by an automated process.
4.  **Ensured and Reconciled:** Software agents (Operators/Controllers) running in the cluster continuously observe the actual system state and reconcile it with the desired state defined in Git. They correct any configuration drift automatically.

**Benefits of GitOps:**

*   **Increased Productivity:** Developers use familiar Git workflows to manage deployments.
*   **Enhanced Reliability:** Automated reconciliation ensures the cluster state matches Git, reducing drift and configuration errors. Rollbacks are as simple as reverting a Git commit.
*   **Improved Security:** Git provides strong guarantees on authorship and history. Access control can be managed via Git permissions. Secrets management needs careful consideration (e.g., using tools like Sealed Secrets or external secret managers).
*   **Consistency and Standardization:** Enforces declarative configurations and automated deployments across teams and environments.
*   **Auditability:** Git history provides a clear log of all changes, who made them, and when.

**Popular GitOps Tools for Kubernetes:**

Two leading open-source GitOps tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem are:

1.  **Argo CD:** ([https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/))
    *   A declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
    *   Runs as a controller in the cluster.
    *   Monitors Git repositories containing Kubernetes manifests (plain YAML, Kustomize, Helm charts, Jsonnet).
    *   Compares the live state in the cluster with the desired state in Git.
    *   Visualizes differences and allows manual or automatic synchronization (applying changes).
    *   Provides a Web UI and CLI for managing applications and sync status.

2.  **Flux CD:** ([https://fluxcd.io/](https://fluxcd.io/))
    *   A set of continuous and progressive delivery solutions for Kubernetes, built using the Kubernetes controller/operator pattern (often referred to as the "GitOps Toolkit").
    *   Uses multiple controllers (e.g., `source-controller`, `kustomize-controller`, `helm-controller`) running in the cluster.
    *   Watches Git repositories (and other sources like Helm repositories, S3 buckets).
    *   Reconciles the cluster state based on defined resources (e.g., `Kustomization`, `HelmRelease`).
    *   Focuses heavily on automation and declarative configuration via CRDs.

Both tools achieve the core GitOps principles but have slightly different architectures, features, and user experiences.

## Syncing Kubernetes Manifests with Git

The core GitOps workflow for application deployment looks like this:

1.  **Define Application:** Developers define their application using Kubernetes manifests (YAML files for Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) or higher-level tools like Helm or Kustomize.
2.  **Commit to Git:** These manifests are committed to a dedicated Git repository (often called the "config repo" or "manifest repo"). Different branches might represent different environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `main` for production).
3.  **CI Pipeline (Optional but Recommended):** A Continuous Integration pipeline builds the application container image, runs tests, and pushes the image to a registry. It might then update the image tag in the Kubernetes manifests within the Git repository (e.g., using `kustomize edit set image` or modifying Helm `values.yaml`).
4.  **GitOps Tool Watches Git:** The GitOps tool (Argo CD or Flux) running in the cluster continuously monitors the target branch in the Git repository.
5.  **Detect Changes:** When a change is merged (e.g., a new image tag, updated replica count), the GitOps tool detects the difference between the desired state in Git and the live state in the cluster.
6.  **Reconcile/Sync:** The GitOps tool applies the necessary changes (`kubectl apply`, `helm upgrade`, etc.) to the Kubernetes cluster to make the live state match the desired state from Git. This can be configured for automatic or manual synchronization.
7.  **Monitor and Correct Drift:** The tool continuously monitors the deployed resources. If someone makes a manual change via `kubectl edit`, the GitOps tool will detect this drift and (usually) automatically revert the change to match the state defined in Git.

## Combining Terraform and GitOps

Terraform and GitOps tools like Argo CD/Flux are often used together, but they typically manage different layers:

*   **Terraform:** Primarily used for provisioning and managing **infrastructure resources**, which could include:
    *   The underlying cloud resources (VPCs, subnets, IAM roles, databases).
    *   The Kubernetes cluster itself (EKS, GKE, AKS control plane and node groups).
    *   Potentially cluster-wide resources needed *before* applications run (e.g., installing the GitOps tool itself, CRDs, cluster-level operators, namespaces).
*   **GitOps Tools (Argo CD/Flux):** Primarily used for deploying and managing **applications and configurations *running inside* the Kubernetes cluster**. This includes:
    *   Deployments, StatefulSets, Services, Ingresses.
    *   ConfigMaps, Secrets (potentially using Sealed Secrets or external managers).
    *   Application-specific CRs managed by Operators.

**Integration Patterns:**

1.  **Clear Separation (Common):** Terraform manages the cluster and essential platform services (Ingress controller, cert-manager, GitOps tool itself). The GitOps tool then takes over managing all application deployments based on separate application config repositories.
2.  **Terraform Bootstrapping GitOps:** Terraform creates the cluster and deploys the GitOps tool (e.g., using the Helm provider). The GitOps tool configuration (pointing to application repositories) might also be managed by Terraform initially.
3.  **Terraform Managing Argo CD/Flux Applications (Less Common):** You *can* use Terraform's Kubernetes or Helm provider to create Argo CD `Application` CRs or Flux `Kustomization`/`HelmRelease` CRs. This means Terraform defines *which* apps the GitOps tool should manage. This can centralize definitions but blurs the lines between infrastructure and application management.

**Recommendation:** Start with a clear separation. Use Terraform for the cluster and platform setup. Use Argo CD or Flux for application deployments, pulling manifests from dedicated application configuration repositories.

## Lab: Set up GitOps for a Kubernetes Application with Argo CD

This lab demonstrates installing Argo CD and configuring it to automatically deploy and synchronize a simple application from a Git repository.

**Prerequisites:**

*   `kubectl` connected to a running Kubernetes cluster.
*   Helm v3 installed.
*   A GitHub account and a **public** Git repository you can push to. (You can use private repos, but setup is slightly more complex).

**Steps:**

1.  **Create Sample Application Manifests:**
    *   Create a **new public Git repository** on GitHub (e.g., `my-gitops-app`).
    *   Clone the repository locally.
    *   Inside the repository, create a directory structure, e.g., `app/`.
    *   Inside `app/`, create `deployment.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        # app/deployment.yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: ui-deployment
        spec:
          replicas: 2 # Start with 2 replicas
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: simple-ui
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: simple-ui
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: ui
                image: nginx:1.21 # Initial version
                ports:
                - containerPort: 80
        ```
    *   Inside `app/`, create `service.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        # app/service.yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: ui-service
        spec:
          selector:
            app: simple-ui
          ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 80
            targetPort: 80
          type: ClusterIP
        ```
    *   Commit and push these files to your GitHub repository's `main` branch. Note down the HTTPS URL of your repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/my-gitops-app.git`).

2.  **Install Argo CD:**
    Install Argo CD into your cluster using its official Helm chart.
    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace argocd
    helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
    helm repo update
    # Install Argo CD
    helm install argocd argo/argo-cd --namespace argocd
    ```
    Wait for the Argo CD pods to become ready: `kubectl get pods -n argocd -w`

3.  **Access Argo CD UI:**
    Argo CD server is not exposed externally by default. Use port-forwarding:
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward service/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
    ```
    *   Open `https://localhost:8080` in your browser (accept any self-signed certificate warning).
    *   The initial username is `admin`.
    *   Get the initial admin password (it's stored in a secret):
        ```bash
        kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo
        ```
    *   Log in using `admin` and the retrieved password. You should change this password for production.

4.  **Create Argo CD Application:**
    We'll define an Argo CD `Application` CRD to tell Argo CD about our Git repository and how to deploy it. Save as `argocd-app.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: simple-ui-app
      namespace: argocd # Deploy the Application object into Argo CD's namespace
    spec:
      project: default # Use the default Argo CD project
      source:
        repoURL: https://github.com/your-username/my-gitops-app.git # !!! REPLACE with your repo URL !!!
        targetRevision: HEAD # Track the latest commit on the default branch (main)
        path: app # Directory within the repo containing manifests
      destination:
        server: https://kubernetes.default.svc # Deploy to the same cluster Argo CD is in
        namespace: default # Deploy the application into the 'default' namespace
      syncPolicy: # Configure automatic synchronization
        automated:
          prune: true # Delete resources that are removed from Git
          selfHeal: true # Automatically sync if cluster state drifts from Git
        syncOptions:
        - CreateNamespace=true # Automatically create the destination namespace if it doesn't exist
    ```
    **Important:** Replace `https://github.com/your-username/my-gitops-app.git` with the actual URL of *your* public Git repository created in Step 1.

    Apply this manifest: `kubectl apply -f argocd-app.yaml`

5.  **Verify in Argo CD UI and Cluster:**
    *   Go back to the Argo CD UI (`https://localhost:8080`). You should see the `simple-ui-app` application card appear.
    *   Initially, it might show as `Missing` and `OutOfSync`. Argo CD should automatically start syncing shortly (due to `syncPolicy.automated`).
    *   Once synced, the status should become `Healthy` and `Synced`. Click on the application card to see the deployed resources (Deployment, Service, Pods).
    *   Verify in your terminal:
        ```bash
        kubectl get deployment ui-deployment -n default
        kubectl get service ui-service -n default
        kubectl get pods -l app=simple-ui -n default # Should see 2 pods running
        ```

6.  **Make a Change in Git:**
    *   Go back to your local clone of the `my-gitops-app` repository.
    *   Edit `app/deployment.yaml`. Change `replicas: 2` to `replicas: 3`.
    *   Commit and push the change to GitHub:
        ```bash
        git add app/deployment.yaml
        git commit -m "Increase UI replicas to 3"
        git push origin main
        ```

7.  **Observe Automatic Update:**
    *   Watch the Argo CD UI. Within a few minutes (Argo CD polls Git periodically), the `simple-ui-app` should briefly show `OutOfSync` and then automatically sync again.
    *   The Deployment resource within the UI should reflect the change to 3 replicas.
    *   Verify in your terminal:
        ```bash
        kubectl get deployment ui-deployment -n default # Should show DESIRED=3, CURRENT=3
        kubectl get pods -l app=simple-ui -n default # Should eventually show 3 pods running
        ```
    Argo CD detected the change in Git and automatically applied it to the cluster.

8.  **Clean Up:**
    *   Delete the Argo CD application: `kubectl delete -f argocd-app.yaml` (This tells Argo CD to stop managing the app; it might not delete the deployed resources unless configured differently or pruned).
    *   Uninstall Argo CD: `helm uninstall argocd --namespace argocd`
    *   Delete the namespace: `kubectl delete namespace argocd`
    *   Delete the deployed application resources: `kubectl delete deployment ui-deployment -n default` and `kubectl delete service ui-service -n default`.
    *   Delete your local Git repository clone and the repository on GitHub if desired.
    *   Stop the `kubectl port-forward` command.

**Congratulations!** You have set up a basic GitOps workflow using Argo CD. You defined your application declaratively in Git, and Argo CD automatically deployed and updated it in your Kubernetes cluster based on changes committed to the repository. This demonstrates the power of GitOps for automating and managing Kubernetes deployments reliably.
