# Chapter 15: Custom Resources and Operators

Kubernetes is highly extensible. While built-in objects like Deployments, Services, and StatefulSets cover many common use cases, you often encounter scenarios requiring custom abstractions or automation specific to your applications or infrastructure. This chapter explores how to extend the Kubernetes API using **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** and how to automate the management of these custom resources using the **Operator pattern**.

## Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

A **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)** allows you to define your *own* object types within the Kubernetes API, extending its schema. Once a CRD is created, you can create instances of that custom type, called **Custom Resources (CRs)**, just like you create built-in objects like Pods or Deployments using `kubectl` and YAML manifests.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Define new types of resources specific to your domain (e.g., `Database`, `WebApp`, `BackupJob`, `CronTab`).
    *   Store and retrieve structured data related to these custom types using the Kubernetes API.
    *   Provide a declarative API for managing custom applications or infrastructure components.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  You define the CRD itself as a Kubernetes object (kind: `CustomResourceDefinition`). This definition specifies:
        *   `group`: The API group for your custom resource (e.g., `mycompany.com`).
        *   `versions`: API versions for your resource (e.g., `v1alpha1`, `v1beta1`, `v1`). Each version has an associated schema.
        *   `scope`: Whether the resource is `Namespaced` or `Cluster`-scoped.
        *   `names`: How the resource will be referred to (e.g., `kind`, `plural`, `singular`, `shortNames`).
        *   `schema`: An OpenAPI v3 schema defining the structure and validation rules for your Custom Resource objects (e.g., required fields, data types).
    2.  You apply the CRD manifest to your cluster (`kubectl apply -f my-crd.yaml`).
    3.  The Kubernetes API server dynamically creates a new REST API endpoint for your custom resource (e.g., `/apis/mycompany.com/v1/namespaces/*/myresources`).
    4.  You can now create, read, update, and delete instances (CRs) of your custom resource using `kubectl` and YAML manifests specifying `apiVersion: mycompany.com/v1` and `kind: MyResource`.

*Example CRD Definition (`crontab-crd.yaml`):*
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  # name must be in the format: <plural>.<group>
  name: crontabs.stable.example.com
spec:
  # group name to use for REST API: /apis/<group>/<version>
  group: stable.example.com
  # list of versions supported by this CRD
  versions:
    - name: v1
      # Each version can be enabled/disabled by Served flag.
      served: true
      # One and only one version must be marked as the storage version.
      storage: true
      schema:
        # schema used for validation, pruning, and defaulting
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                cronSpec:
                  type: string
                  description: "Cron schedule string"
                  pattern: '^(\*|([0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-9]|4[0-9]|5[0-9])|\*\/([0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-9]|4[0-9]|5[0-9])) (\*|([0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3])|\*\/([0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3])) (\*|([1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1])|\*\/([1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1])) (\*|([1-9]|1[0-2])|\*\/([1-9]|1[0-2])) (\*|([0-6])|\*\/([0-6]))$'
                image:
                  type: string
                  description: "Container image to run"
                replicas:
                  type: integer
                  minimum: 1
                  maximum: 10
                  description: "Number of replicas (example field)"
              required: ["cronSpec", "image"] # Required fields in the spec
            status: # Optional status sub-resource
              type: object
              properties:
                replicas:
                  type: integer
                lastScheduleTime:
                   type: string
                   format: date-time
  # either Namespaced or Cluster
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    # plural name to be used in the URL: /apis/<group>/<version>/<plural>
    plural: crontabs
    # singular name to be used as an alias on the CLI and for display
    singular: crontab
    # kind is normally the CamelCased singular type. Your resource manifests use this.
    kind: CronTab
    # shortNames allow shorter string to match your resource on the CLI
    shortNames:
    - ct
```

*Example Custom Resource (`my-crontab-cr.yaml`):*
```yaml
apiVersion: "stable.example.com/v1" # Matches CRD group and version
kind: CronTab # Matches CRD kind
metadata:
  name: my-new-cron-object
  # namespace: default # If namespaced scope
spec: # Fields defined in the CRD schema's spec section
  cronSpec: "*/5 * * * *"
  image: my-awesome-cron-image:latest
  replicas: 1
```

**Benefits of CRDs:**

*   **Native Feel:** Custom resources behave like built-in Kubernetes objects (managed via `kubectl`, RBAC applies, etc.).
*   **Declarative API:** Provides a structured, declarative way to manage custom concepts.
*   **Foundation for Automation:** CRDs define the API; Operators (controllers) provide the automation logic.

## The Operator Pattern

Creating a CRD defines a new resource type, but it doesn't automatically *do* anything when you create instances (CRs) of that type. An **Operator** is a custom Kubernetes controller that watches for changes to specific resources (usually Custom Resources, but can also be built-in ones) and takes actions to reconcile the current state of the system with the desired state declared in the resource object.

*   **Concept:** Encapsulates human operational knowledge (how to deploy, manage, scale, backup, upgrade a specific application or service) into software that runs inside Kubernetes.
*   **Purpose:** Automate the entire lifecycle management of complex (often stateful) applications defined by CRDs.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  An Operator is typically deployed as a Pod (often managed by a Deployment) within the cluster.
    2.  It uses the Kubernetes API (specifically "informers") to watch for create, update, and delete events for the CRDs it manages.
    3.  When an event occurs (e.g., a `CronTab` CR is created or updated), the Operator's **reconciliation loop** is triggered.
    4.  Inside the loop, the Operator code reads the desired state from the CR's `spec`.
    5.  It checks the current state of the system (e.g., are the corresponding Kubernetes Jobs running for the `CronTab`?).
    6.  It takes actions (using the Kubernetes API) to make the current state match the desired state (e.g., create/update/delete Jobs based on the `cronSpec` and `image` from the `CronTab` CR).
    7.  Optionally, it updates the `status` sub-resource of the CR to reflect the actual state (e.g., update `lastScheduleTime` in the `CronTab` status).

**Benefits of Operators:**

*   **Automation:** Automates complex Day-2 operations (scaling, backups, upgrades, failure recovery) beyond basic deployment.
*   **Self-Healing:** Can automatically detect and correct deviations from the desired state.
*   **Declarative Management:** Users interact with the high-level CR, and the Operator handles the low-level details.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures applications are deployed and managed consistently according to best practices encoded in the Operator.
*   **Integration:** Leverages Kubernetes primitives (RBAC, scheduling, service discovery).

**Examples of Operators:**

*   Database Operators (e.g., PostgreSQL Operator, MySQL Operator, MongoDB Operator)
*   Monitoring Operators (e.g., Prometheus Operator)
*   Messaging Queue Operators (e.g., Kafka Operator - Strimzi)
*   Storage Operators (e.g., Rook for Ceph)
*   Certificate Management (e.g., cert-manager)

## Building Operators: Operator SDK and Kubebuilder

Developing Operators from scratch can be complex. Frameworks exist to simplify the process:

*   **Operator SDK:** ([https://sdk.operatorframework.io/](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/)) Part of the Operator Framework project. Provides CLIs and libraries to scaffold Operator projects using Go, Ansible, or Helm. Generates boilerplate code for CRDs, controllers, RBAC, and build/deployment manifests.
*   **Kubebuilder:** ([https://book.kubebuilder.io/](https://book.kubebuilder.io/)) A framework focused on building Kubernetes APIs using CRDs in Go. It provides tools to generate API definitions, controller logic skeletons, and manifests. Operator SDK uses Kubebuilder libraries internally for its Go-based Operators.

These tools significantly reduce the effort required to build robust Operators by handling common tasks and providing a structured project layout.

## Lab: Create a Simple CRD and Custom Resource

This lab focuses on defining a CRD and interacting with its Custom Resources using `kubectl`. We won't build a full Operator controller in this lab, but we'll see how the API extension works.

**Prerequisites:**

*   `kubectl` connected to a running Kubernetes cluster.

**Steps:**

1.  **Define the CRD:**
    Save the following as `webapp-crd.yaml`. We'll define a simple `WebApp` resource.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
    kind: CustomResourceDefinition
    metadata:
      name: webapps.stable.example.com # <plural>.<group>
    spec:
      group: stable.example.com
      scope: Namespaced # Resource will exist within namespaces
      names:
        plural: webapps
        singular: webapp
        kind: WebApp # Kind used in manifests
        shortNames:
        - wa
      versions:
        - name: v1
          served: true
          storage: true
          schema:
            openAPIV3Schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                spec:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    image:
                      type: string
                      description: "Container image for the web app"
                    replicas:
                      type: integer
                      minimum: 1
                      description: "Number of desired replicas"
                    port:
                      type: integer
                      default: 8080
                      description: "Container port to expose"
                    configMapName: # Example: Reference another K8s object
                      type: string
                      description: "Name of the ConfigMap holding app settings"
                  required: ["image", "replicas"] # image and replicas are mandatory
                status: # Define a simple status sub-resource
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    availableReplicas:
                      type: integer
                    url:
                      type: string
          # Enable the status sub-resource
          subresources:
            status: {}
    ```

2.  **Apply the CRD:**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f webapp-crd.yaml
    # Output: customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/webapps.stable.example.com created
    ```
    Wait a few seconds for the API server to register the new endpoint.

3.  **Verify CRD:**
    ```bash
    kubectl api-resources | grep webapp
    # Should show: webapps wa stable.example.com true WebApp

    kubectl explain webapp.spec # Use kubectl explain on the custom resource!
    # Shows the schema defined in the CRD
    ```

4.  **Create a Custom Resource (CR):**
    Save as `my-webapp-cr.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: stable.example.com/v1 # Use the group/version from CRD
    kind: WebApp # Use the kind from CRD
    metadata:
      name: my-first-webapp
      namespace: default # Since it's namespaced
    spec:
      image: my-web-image:v1.2
      replicas: 3
      configMapName: my-app-settings # Just storing the name here
      # port: 8080 # Using default from schema
    ```
    Apply it: `kubectl apply -f my-webapp-cr.yaml`
    # Output: webapp.stable.example.com/my-first-webapp created

5.  **Interact with the Custom Resource:**
    Use `kubectl` just like with built-in resources:
    ```bash
    kubectl get webapp # List WebApp resources (or use shortname: kubectl get wa)
    # NAME                AGE
    # my-first-webapp     15s

    kubectl get webapp my-first-webapp -o yaml # Get the full YAML, including status (empty for now)
    # apiVersion: stable.example.com/v1
    # kind: WebApp
    # metadata:
    #   name: my-first-webapp
    #   namespace: default
    #   ... other metadata ...
    # spec:
    #   configMapName: my-app-settings
    #   image: my-web-image:v1.2
    #   port: 8080
    #   replicas: 3
    # status: {} # Status is empty because no controller is updating it

    kubectl describe webapp my-first-webapp
    # Shows Spec fields

    kubectl edit webapp my-first-webapp # You can edit the CR
    # (Change replicas to 2, save and exit)

    kubectl get webapp my-first-webapp -o yaml # Verify the change in spec.replicas
    ```

6.  **Clean Up:**
    ```bash
    kubectl delete webapp my-first-webapp
    kubectl delete crd webapps.stable.example.com
    # Delete the YAML files if desired
    ```

**Congratulations!** You have successfully extended the Kubernetes API by defining a Custom Resource Definition (`WebApp`) and managing instances (Custom Resources) of that type using standard `kubectl` commands. While nothing happened automatically (no Pods were created), this demonstrates the foundation upon which Operators are built to automate the management of these custom application types.
