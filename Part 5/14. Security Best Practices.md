# Chapter 14: Security Best Practices

Security is not an afterthought; it's a critical aspect of designing, deploying, and managing Kubernetes clusters and applications. Kubernetes provides numerous features to enhance security, but they must be understood and configured correctly. This chapter covers fundamental security best practices, including access control (RBAC), Pod security, container image hardening, and network security considerations.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is the primary mechanism for controlling *who* can perform *what* actions on *which* resources within a Kubernetes cluster. It's crucial for enforcing the principle of least privilege.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Subject:** Who is performing the action?
    *   `User`: Represents a human user. Kubernetes doesn't manage users directly; they are typically authenticated via external methods (certificates, tokens, OIDC) and referenced by name.
    *   `Group`: A set of users. Also externally managed.
    *   `ServiceAccount`: Represents an application or process running *within* a Pod that needs to interact with the Kubernetes API. ServiceAccounts are managed by Kubernetes.
*   **Resource:** What Kubernetes object is being acted upon? (e.g., `pods`, `deployments`, `services`, `nodes`, `configmaps`, `secrets`).
*   **Verb:** What action is being performed? (e.g., `get`, `list`, `watch`, `create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`).
*   **Rule:** A combination of verbs allowed on a set of resources.
*   **Role / ClusterRole:** A collection of rules defining permissions.
    *   `Role`: Namespaced. Grants permissions *within* a specific namespace.
    *   `ClusterRole`: Cluster-wide. Grants permissions across *all* namespaces or on cluster-scoped resources (like `nodes`, `namespaces`, `persistentvolumes`). Can also grant access to non-resource URLs (like `/healthz`).
*   **RoleBinding / ClusterRoleBinding:** Connects (binds) a subject (User, Group, ServiceAccount) to a Role or ClusterRole, effectively granting the permissions defined in that role to the subject.
    *   `RoleBinding`: Grants permissions defined in a Role or ClusterRole *within* a specific namespace.
    *   `ClusterRoleBinding`: Grants permissions defined in a ClusterRole *across the entire cluster*. Use with extreme caution, especially when binding to `cluster-admin` or similar powerful ClusterRoles.

**Workflow:**

1.  Define *what* actions are allowed on *which* resources (Rules).
2.  Group these rules into a `Role` (namespaced) or `ClusterRole` (cluster-wide).
3.  Define *who* (Subject: User, Group, ServiceAccount) needs these permissions.
4.  Create a `RoleBinding` (namespaced) or `ClusterRoleBinding` (cluster-wide) to grant the Role/ClusterRole to the Subject.

**Example: Read-Only Access to a Namespace**

```yaml
# 1. Define the Role (namespaced)
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: development # Role exists only in 'development' namespace
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods", "pods/log"] # Allow access to pods and their logs
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"] # Read-only verbs

---
# 2. Define the Subject (e.g., a user named 'dev-user')
# (User creation is external, we just reference the name)

---
# 3. Bind the User to the Role within the namespace
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods-binding
  namespace: development # Binding applies only within 'development'
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: dev-user # Name is case-sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef: # The Role being granted
  kind: Role # Can be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-reader # Name of the Role created above
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

**Example: ServiceAccount for an Application**

```yaml
# 1. Create a ServiceAccount for the application Pod
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: myapp-sa
  namespace: production

---
# 2. Define a Role granting permissions needed by the app (e.g., list endpoints)
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: production
  name: endpoint-lister
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["endpoints", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]

---
# 3. Bind the ServiceAccount to the Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: myapp-lister-binding
  namespace: production
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: myapp-sa # Name of the ServiceAccount
  namespace: production
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: endpoint-lister
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

---
# 4. Configure the Pod to use the ServiceAccount
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
  namespace: production
spec:
  # ... replicas, selector ...
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: myapp-sa # Assign the ServiceAccount to the Pod
      containers:
      - name: myapp-container
        image: myapp:latest
        # ... ports, etc ...
```

**Best Practices:**

*   **Least Privilege:** Grant only the permissions absolutely necessary for a user or service account to perform its function.
*   **Use Roles over ClusterRoles:** Prefer namespaced Roles and RoleBindings whenever possible to limit scope.
*   **Avoid `cluster-admin`:** Grant the powerful `cluster-admin` ClusterRole very sparingly.
*   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review Roles, ClusterRoles, and Bindings to ensure they are still necessary and appropriate.
*   **Group Bindings:** Manage permissions for groups of users rather than individual users where possible.

## Pod Security Policies and Admission Controllers

While RBAC controls *who* can do *what*, **Pod Security Admission (PSA)** controls *what* Pods are allowed to run based on their security context (e.g., running as root, accessing host resources).

**Pod Security Standards:**

Kubernetes defines three standard security profiles:

1.  **Privileged:** Unrestricted, wide-open permissions. Should be avoided unless absolutely necessary (e.g., for certain system-level components). Allows known privilege escalations.
2.  **Baseline:** Minimally restrictive policy preventing known privilege escalations. Disallows hostNetwork, hostPID, hostIPC, hostPath volumes, privileged containers, etc., while allowing most common application configurations. A good default starting point.
3.  **Restricted:** Heavily restricted, follows current Pod hardening best practices. Requires running as non-root, disallows `ALLOW_PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION`, restricts volumes, requires specific seccomp/AppArmor profiles, etc. Offers the best security but might require application modifications.

**Pod Security Admission (PSA):**

*   **Concept:** A built-in admission controller (enabled by default in recent Kubernetes versions) that enforces Pod Security Standards at the **namespace level**.
*   **How it works:** You apply labels to namespaces to indicate which Pod Security Standard should be enforced.
    ```bash
    # Example: Enforce 'baseline' standard, audit 'restricted', warn on 'restricted'
    kubectl label --overwrite ns my-namespace \
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=baseline \
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit=restricted \
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=restricted
    ```
*   **Modes:**
    *   `enforce`: Pods violating the policy are rejected.
    *   `audit`: Violations are recorded in the audit log but Pods are allowed.
    *   `warn`: Violations trigger user-facing warnings (`kubectl` output) but Pods are allowed.
*   **Recommendation:** Start by enforcing `baseline` on most application namespaces and potentially `restricted` on namespaces requiring higher security. Audit or warn on `restricted` initially to identify Pods needing modification before enforcing it.

**PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) - Deprecated:**

*   PSP was the previous mechanism for enforcing Pod security. It was cluster-wide, more complex to manage (requiring RBAC bindings for Pods/ServiceAccounts to use specific PSPs), and was deprecated in Kubernetes 1.21 and removed in 1.25.
*   **Use Pod Security Admission instead.**

**Other Admission Controllers:**

Kubernetes uses various admission controllers (validating and mutating webhooks) to intercept API requests and enforce policies *before* objects are persisted in etcd. Besides PSA, other important ones include:

*   `LimitRanger`: Enforces resource quotas and default requests/limits per namespace.
*   `ResourceQuota`: Enforces total resource consumption limits per namespace.
*   Policy Engines (e.g., OPA Gatekeeper, Kyverno): Allow defining complex, custom admission policies using external policy engines.

## Securing Container Images

The security of your running containers starts with the security of the images they are built from.

*   **Use Minimal Base Images:** Start with slim, minimal base images (e.g., `alpine`, `distroless`, `scratch`) instead of full OS distributions. This reduces the attack surface by minimizing included libraries, utilities, and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Scan Images for Vulnerabilities:** Integrate image scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Clair, Grype, cloud provider scanners like ECR scanning) into your CI/CD pipeline. Scan images regularly and patch or update base images promptly when vulnerabilities are found.
*   **Run as Non-Root User:** Avoid running containers as the `root` user. Define a non-root `USER` in your Dockerfile and ensure file permissions are set correctly. Use `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup` in the Pod's `securityContext`.
*   **Immutable Images:** Treat container images as immutable artifacts. Do not patch or modify running containers; instead, build and deploy a new image version.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Only include necessary tools and libraries in the image. Remove build tools, compilers, shells (if possible), and unnecessary packages from the final image. Use multi-stage builds in Dockerfiles to achieve this.
*   **Image Signing & Verification:** Use tools like Notary or Sigstore (Cosign) to sign container images, proving their origin and integrity. Configure Kubernetes admission controllers to verify image signatures before allowing Pods to run.

## Network Security with Calico or Cilium

While standard Kubernetes NetworkPolicies (Chapter 6) provide basic Layer 3/4 segmentation, some CNI plugins offer more advanced network security features.

*   **Calico:** A popular open-source CNI known for its robust NetworkPolicy implementation and scalability. It can enforce policies using iptables or eBPF. Offers features beyond standard policies, like global network policies and application-layer policies (commercial offering).
*   **Cilium:** A CNI plugin leveraging **eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** in the Linux kernel.
    *   **Benefits of eBPF:** Allows efficient, programmable network control and observability directly in the kernel.
    *   **Features:**
        *   **Identity-Based Security:** Security rules based on Kubernetes labels/identities rather than just IP addresses.
        *   **API-Aware Security (Layer 7):** Can enforce policies based on HTTP methods/paths (e.g., allow GET /api/v1/users but deny POST), Kafka topics, gRPC calls, etc.
        *   **Transparent Encryption:** Can automatically encrypt traffic between nodes or Pods.
        *   **Enhanced Observability:** Provides detailed network flow visibility via Hubble UI/CLI.

Using advanced CNIs like Calico or Cilium can significantly enhance network security beyond standard NetworkPolicies, especially for implementing zero-trust models and enforcing fine-grained, application-aware rules. Installation and configuration are more involved than basic CNIs.

## Lab: Implement RBAC and Secure a Pod with Policies

This lab demonstrates creating a restricted ServiceAccount using RBAC and enforcing Pod Security Standards on a namespace.

**Prerequisites:**

*   `kubectl` connected to a running Kubernetes cluster.

**Part 1: RBAC - Restrict ServiceAccount**

1.  **Create Namespace:**
    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace restricted-ns
    ```

2.  **Create ServiceAccount:**
    ```bash
    kubectl create serviceaccount limited-sa -n restricted-ns
    ```

3.  **Create Role (Read-Only Pod Access):**
    Save as `pod-reader-role.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      namespace: restricted-ns
      name: pod-reader-role
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods"]
      verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
    ```
    Apply: `kubectl apply -f pod-reader-role.yaml`

4.  **Create RoleBinding:**
    Save as `limited-sa-binding.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: limited-sa-pod-reader-binding
      namespace: restricted-ns
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: limited-sa
      namespace: restricted-ns
    roleRef:
      kind: Role
      name: pod-reader-role
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```
    Apply: `kubectl apply -f limited-sa-binding.yaml`

5.  **Test Permissions (Simulated):**
    We can use `kubectl auth can-i` impersonating the ServiceAccount.
    ```bash
    # Check if limited-sa can list pods in restricted-ns (Should be YES)
    kubectl auth can-i list pods --as=system:serviceaccount:restricted-ns:limited-sa -n restricted-ns

    # Check if limited-sa can delete pods in restricted-ns (Should be NO)
    kubectl auth can-i delete pods --as=system:serviceaccount:restricted-ns:limited-sa -n restricted-ns

    # Check if limited-sa can list secrets in restricted-ns (Should be NO)
    kubectl auth can-i list secrets --as=system:serviceaccount:restricted-ns:limited-sa -n restricted-ns

    # Check if limited-sa can list pods in default namespace (Should be NO)
    kubectl auth can-i list pods --as=system:serviceaccount:restricted-ns:limited-sa -n default
    ```
    This confirms the ServiceAccount only has the specific read-only pod permissions within its namespace.

**Part 2: Pod Security Admission**

1.  **Label Namespace for Enforcement:**
    Enforce the `restricted` standard on the `restricted-ns` namespace.
    ```bash
    kubectl label --overwrite ns restricted-ns \
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted \
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=restricted \
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit=restricted
    ```

2.  **Attempt to Deploy a Privileged Pod (Should Fail):**
    Save as `privileged-pod.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: privileged-pod
      namespace: restricted-ns # Deploy into the restricted namespace
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        securityContext:
          privileged: true # This violates the 'restricted' standard
    ```
    Apply: `kubectl apply -f privileged-pod.yaml`
    **Expected Output:** The command should fail with an error message similar to:
    `Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "privileged-pod.yaml": pods "privileged-pod" is forbidden: violates PodSecurity "restricted:latest": privileged (...)`

3.  **Attempt to Deploy a Compliant Pod (Should Succeed):**
    Save as `compliant-pod.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: compliant-pod
      namespace: restricted-ns
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        securityContext: # Settings compliant with 'restricted'
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          runAsNonRoot: true
          runAsUser: 1001 # Example non-root user ID
          capabilities:
            drop: ["ALL"] # Drop all capabilities
          seccompProfile:
            type: RuntimeDefault # Use default seccomp profile
    ```
    Apply: `kubectl apply -f compliant-pod.yaml`
    **Expected Output:** `pod/compliant-pod created`. Check its status: `kubectl get pod compliant-pod -n restricted-ns`.

4.  **Clean Up:**
    ```bash
    kubectl delete pod compliant-pod -n restricted-ns # Delete the pod first
    kubectl delete namespace restricted-ns # Deletes SA, Role, Binding too
    # Delete the YAML files if desired
    ```

**Congratulations!** You have implemented RBAC to restrict a ServiceAccount's permissions and used Pod Security Admission to enforce security standards at the namespace level, preventing insecure Pod configurations. These are fundamental steps towards securing your Kubernetes cluster.
