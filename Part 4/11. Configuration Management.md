# Chapter 11: Configuration Management

Applications rarely run in isolation; they need configuration settings, API keys, database credentials, and other external parameters to function correctly. Hardcoding these values into container images is inflexible and insecure. Kubernetes provides dedicated objects, **ConfigMaps** and **Secrets**, to decouple configuration from application code, making deployments more portable, manageable, and secure.

## ConfigMaps for Application Settings

A **ConfigMap** is an API object used to store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or configuration files in a volume.

*   **Purpose:** Store general configuration settings like API endpoints, feature flags, logging levels, or contents of configuration files (e.g., `nginx.conf`, `settings.xml`).
*   **Data Format:** Stores data as key-value pairs. Values are strings. You can store multi-line file content as a single value.
*   **Size Limit:** ConfigMaps are typically limited in size (often around 1 MiB), as they are stored in etcd. They are not designed for large blobs of data.

**Creating ConfigMaps:**

1.  **From Literal Values (Imperative):**
    ```bash
    kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=API_ENDPOINT=http://my-api.example.com --from-literal=LOG_LEVEL=info
    ```

2.  **From Files (Imperative):**
    Create a file, e.g., `config.properties`:
    ```properties
    feature.x.enabled=true
    retry.count=5
    ```
    Create the ConfigMap:
    ```bash
    # Creates a key 'config.properties' with the file content as value
    kubectl create configmap app-settings --from-file=config.properties

    # Creates keys based on filenames in a directory (e.g., 'nginx.conf', 'proxy.conf')
    kubectl create configmap nginx-conf --from-file=./conf-directory/
    ```

3.  **From YAML Manifest (Declarative):** (Recommended for GitOps/IaC)
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: app-config-yaml
    data: # Key-value pairs
      API_ENDPOINT: "http://prod-api.internal"
      LOG_LEVEL: "warn"
      # You can embed file content directly
      nginx.conf: |
        worker_processes 1;
        events { worker_connections 1024; }
        http {
            server {
                listen 80;
                root /usr/share/nginx/html;
                index index.html;
            }
        }
    binaryData: {} # For binary data, base64 encoded
    ```
    Apply with `kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml`.

**Consuming ConfigMaps in Pods:**

1.  **As Environment Variables:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: configmap-env-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: busybox:latest
        command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "echo API endpoint is $MY_API_ENDPOINT and log level is $MY_LOG_LEVEL; sleep 3600" ]
        env:
          # Define environment variable from a specific key in the ConfigMap
          - name: MY_API_ENDPOINT
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: app-config-yaml # Name of the ConfigMap
                key: API_ENDPOINT    # Key within the ConfigMap
          - name: MY_LOG_LEVEL
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: app-config-yaml
                key: LOG_LEVEL
    ```

2.  **Expose All Keys as Environment Variables:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: configmap-envfrom-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: busybox:latest
        command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "env | grep API_ENDPOINT; env | grep LOG_LEVEL; sleep 3600" ]
        envFrom:
          # Expose all keys from the ConfigMap as environment variables
          - configMapRef:
              name: app-config-yaml
    ```

3.  **As Files in a Volume:**
    This is useful for mounting entire configuration files (like `nginx.conf`).
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: configmap-volume-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: nginx-config-volume # Must match volume name below
          mountPath: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf # Mount point inside container
          subPath: nginx.conf # The specific key from ConfigMap to mount as this file
      volumes:
      - name: nginx-config-volume
        configMap:
          # Provide the name of the ConfigMap containing the files
          name: app-config-yaml
          # Optional: Specify which keys to mount, default is all keys
          # items:
          # - key: nginx.conf
          #   path: nginx.conf # The filename within the volume mount
    ```
    *   Each key in the `data` section of the ConfigMap becomes a file in the mounted directory (`/etc/nginx/` if `subPath` wasn't used).
    *   Using `subPath` mounts only the specified key as a single file at the `mountPath`.

**Updating ConfigMaps:**

*   If you update a ConfigMap (`kubectl edit configmap` or `kubectl apply` a changed manifest), Pods consuming it via **volumes** will *eventually* see the changes (the update propagation delay depends on kubelet sync). The mounted files are updated.
*   Pods consuming ConfigMaps via **environment variables** will **NOT** see the changes automatically. The Pod needs to be restarted (e.g., by deleting it so the Deployment recreates it) to pick up the new environment variables.

## Secrets for Sensitive Data

**Secrets** are very similar to ConfigMaps but are intended for storing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, TLS certificates, and Docker registry credentials.

*   **Purpose:** Store confidential data needed by applications.
*   **Encoding:** Data in Secrets is stored **base64 encoded** by default. **This is NOT encryption!** Base64 is easily reversible. Secrets provide obscurity, not true confidentiality at rest within etcd unless etcd encryption is configured separately.
*   **Access Control:** Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) can be used to restrict who can read Secret objects.
*   **Automatic Usage:** Kubernetes uses Secrets for specific purposes, like pulling images from private registries (`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`) or providing TLS certificates to Ingress controllers (`kubernetes.io/tls`).
*   **Size Limit:** Similar to ConfigMaps, typically around 1 MiB.

**Creating Secrets:**

1.  **From Literal Values (Imperative):**
    Values are automatically base64 encoded.
    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic db-credentials --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password='S3cr3tP@ssw0rd!'
    ```

2.  **From Files (Imperative):**
    File content is used directly as the value (and base64 encoded).
    ```bash
    # Create files first
    echo -n 'superadmin' > ./username.txt
    echo -n 'P@$$wOrd!123' > ./password.txt
    kubectl create secret generic api-key --from-file=./username.txt --from-file=./password.txt
    ```

3.  **From YAML Manifest (Declarative):** (Recommended)
    You must provide **base64 encoded** strings in the `data` section.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-secret-yaml
    type: Opaque # Arbitrary user-defined data (default)
    # Other types: kubernetes.io/service-account-token, kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson, kubernetes.io/tls, etc.
    data: # Values MUST be base64 encoded
      # echo -n 'admin' | base64 -> YWRtaW4=
      db.username: YWRtaW4=
      # echo -n 'AnotherS3cr3t' | base64 -> QW5vdGhlclMzY3IzdA==
      db.password: QW5vdGhlclMzY3IzdA==
    # stringData: # Alternative: Provide plain strings, Kubernetes encodes them for you
    #   api.key: "abc123xyz789"
    #   tls.crt: |
    #     -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    #     ... certificate data ...
    #     -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```
    Apply with `kubectl apply -f secret.yaml`.

**Consuming Secrets in Pods:**

Secrets are consumed in the *exact same ways* as ConfigMaps:

1.  **As Environment Variables:**
    ```yaml
    env:
      - name: DB_USERNAME
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: db-credentials # Name of the Secret
            key: username       # Key within the Secret
      - name: DB_PASSWORD
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: db-credentials
            key: password
    ```

2.  **Expose All Keys as Environment Variables:**
    ```yaml
    envFrom:
      - secretRef:
          name: db-credentials
    ```

3.  **As Files in a Volume:** (Recommended for multi-line secrets like TLS keys/certs)
    ```yaml
    volumeMounts:
    - name: secret-volume
      mountPath: /etc/secrets # Mount directory
      readOnly: true # Good practice for secrets
    volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretName: my-secret-yaml
        # Optional: items to mount specific keys
        # items:
        # - key: tls.crt
        #   path: server.crt
    ```
    *   Files mounted from Secrets have their permissions set appropriately (usually read-only for the user).

**Updating Secrets:**

*   Similar to ConfigMaps, updates to Secrets consumed via **volumes** are eventually propagated to the Pod.
*   Updates to Secrets consumed via **environment variables** require a Pod restart.

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Etcd Encryption:** For true confidentiality at rest, enable EncryptionConfiguration for Secrets in the Kubernetes API server to encrypt Secret data within etcd.
*   **RBAC:** Use Kubernetes RBAC to strictly limit who can create, read, or update Secret objects.
*   **External Secret Management:** For more robust secret management, consider tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or GCP Secret Manager, often integrated with Kubernetes via operators or CSI drivers (e.g., Secrets Store CSI Driver). These tools provide features like dynamic secrets, rotation, and auditing.

## Environment Variables and Command-Line Arguments

Besides ConfigMaps and Secrets, you can pass configuration directly via environment variables or command-line arguments in the Pod spec.

*   **Environment Variables (`env`):**
    ```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myimage:latest
        env:
          - name: STATIC_VAR # Simple static value
            value: "some_value"
          - name: POD_IP     # Using Downward API to expose Pod info
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: status.podIP
          # ... plus env vars from ConfigMaps/Secrets ...
    ```
*   **Command-Line Arguments (`command`, `args`):**
    You can override the container's `ENTRYPOINT` (`command`) and `CMD` (`args`). This can be used to pass configuration flags. You can substitute environment variables (including those from ConfigMaps/Secrets) into args.
    ```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myimage:latest
        env:
          - name: API_KEY
            valueFrom: { secretKeyRef: { name: api-secret, key: key } }
        command: ["/app/start"] # Override ENTRYPOINT
        args: [ # Override CMD
          "--listen-port", "8080",
          "--log-level", "$(LOG_LEVEL)", # Substitute env var (if defined)
          "--api-key", "$(API_KEY)"      # Substitute secret env var
        ]
    ```

**Choosing the Right Method:**

*   **ConfigMaps:** Best for non-sensitive configuration, especially file-based configs or numerous settings. Updates via volumes are reflected without restart.
*   **Secrets:** Essential for sensitive data. Updates via volumes are reflected; updates via env vars require restart. Use RBAC and consider external managers for higher security.
*   **Direct `env`:** Suitable for a few simple, non-sensitive, static variables or exposing Pod metadata via Downward API.
*   **`command`/`args`:** Useful for passing flags or when the application specifically expects command-line configuration. Can be combined with env var substitution.

## Managing Configuration Drift

Configuration drift occurs when the actual configuration running in the cluster diverges from the desired state defined in your manifests (e.g., someone uses `kubectl edit` to change a ConfigMap directly).

**Strategies to Manage Drift:**

*   **Declarative Approach:** Always use `kubectl apply -f <file>` or GitOps tools. Avoid imperative commands (`kubectl create`, `kubectl edit`) for managing configuration objects in production.
*   **Version Control:** Store all ConfigMap and Secret manifests in Git.
*   **GitOps:** Use tools like Argo CD or Flux. These tools continuously monitor your Git repository and automatically apply changes to the cluster, ensuring the cluster state matches the Git state. They can detect and optionally correct drift.
*   **Auditing:** Use Kubernetes audit logs to track changes made to ConfigMap and Secret objects.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Use tools like OPA Gatekeeper or Kyverno to enforce policies, such as preventing direct edits to specific ConfigMaps/Secrets.

## Lab: Deploy an App with ConfigMaps and Secrets

This lab deploys a simple application that reads configuration from both a ConfigMap and a Secret, demonstrating different consumption methods.

**Prerequisites:**
*   `kubectl` connected to a running Kubernetes cluster.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create ConfigMap Manifest (`app-config.yaml`):**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: my-app-config
    data:
      app.properties: |
        greeting=Hello from ConfigMap!
        log.level=DEBUG
      special.value: "ConfigMap Volume Data"
    ```

2.  **Create Secret Manifest (`app-secret.yaml`):**
    (Remember to base64 encode the values)
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-app-secret
    type: Opaque
    data:
      # echo -n 'admin-user' | base64 -> YWRtaW4tdXNlcg==
      username: YWRtaW4tdXNlcg==
      # echo -n 'verySecretKey123' | base64 -> dmVyeVNlY3JldEtleTEyMw==
      api.key: dmVyeVNlY3JldEtleTEyMw==
    ```

3.  **Apply ConfigMap and Secret:**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f app-config.yaml
    kubectl apply -f app-secret.yaml
    ```

4.  **Create Pod Manifest (`app-pod.yaml`):**
    This Pod uses various methods to consume the configuration.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: config-demo-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app-container
        image: busybox:latest
        # Command to display consumed config/secrets
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
          - >
            echo "--- Environment Variables ---";
            echo "USERNAME_SECRET: $USERNAME_SECRET";
            echo "API_KEY_SECRET: $API_KEY_SECRET";
            echo "LOG_LEVEL_CM: $LOG_LEVEL_CM";
            echo "";
            echo "--- ConfigMap Volume Mount (/etc/config) ---";
            ls -l /etc/config;
            echo "Content of app.properties:";
            cat /etc/config/app.properties;
            echo "";
            echo "--- Secret Volume Mount (/etc/secret) ---";
            ls -l /etc/secret;
            echo "Content of username_file:";
            cat /etc/secret/username_file;
            echo "Content of apikey_file:";
            cat /etc/secret/apikey_file;
            echo "";
            echo "--- ConfigMap Single Value Volume Mount (/etc/special) ---";
            ls -l /etc/special;
            echo "Content of special.txt:";
            cat /etc/special/special.txt;
            sleep 3600
        env:
          # Consume Secret keys as environment variables
          - name: USERNAME_SECRET
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: my-app-secret
                key: username
          - name: API_KEY_SECRET
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: my-app-secret
                key: api.key
          # Consume ConfigMap key as environment variable
          - name: LOG_LEVEL_CM
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: my-app-config
                key: log.level # This key doesn't exist in app-config.yaml, let's see what happens
                               # Correction: It exists within app.properties, not as a top-level key.
                               # Let's change this to use a key that *does* exist directly.
                               # We'll add one to the ConfigMap later.
                               # For now, let's comment this out or use a valid key if one existed.
                               # Let's assume we add 'log.level.direct: INFO' to the ConfigMap data section.
          # - name: LOG_LEVEL_CM
          #   valueFrom:
          #     configMapKeyRef:
          #       name: my-app-config
          #       key: log.level.direct # Assuming this key exists directly in ConfigMap data

        volumeMounts:
          # Mount the entire ConfigMap as a directory
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /etc/config
          # Mount the entire Secret as a directory
          - name: secret-volume
            mountPath: /etc/secret
            readOnly: true
          # Mount a specific key from ConfigMap as a single file
          - name: config-single-value-volume
            mountPath: /etc/special/special.txt # Mount point is the file itself
            subPath: special.value # Key from ConfigMap to mount

      volumes:
        # Define the ConfigMap volume source
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: my-app-config
            # Mount specific keys as specific filenames within the volume
            items:
              - key: app.properties # Key in ConfigMap
                path: app.properties # Filename in volume
        # Define the Secret volume source
        - name: secret-volume
          secret:
            secretName: my-app-secret
            items:
              - key: username
                path: username_file # Rename the file in the volume
              - key: api.key
                path: apikey_file
        # Define the volume for the single ConfigMap value
        - name: config-single-value-volume
          configMap:
            name: my-app-config
            items:
              - key: special.value
                path: special.value # Path relative to volume root (used by subPath)

      restartPolicy: Never # Run once for demo
    ```
    *(Note: The `LOG_LEVEL_CM` example highlights that `configMapKeyRef` needs a direct key from the `data` section, not a key *within* a file stored in the `data` section. You'd need `log.level.direct: INFO` directly in the ConfigMap `data` for that specific env var example to work as written.)*

5.  **Deploy the Pod:**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f app-pod.yaml
    ```

6.  **Check Pod Logs:**
    Wait for the Pod to complete (or run for a bit):
    ```bash
    kubectl get pod config-demo-pod # Wait until Status is Running or Completed
    kubectl logs config-demo-pod
    ```
    Examine the output. You should see:
    *   The environment variables populated from the Secret.
    *   The files `/etc/config/app.properties` created from the ConfigMap volume.
    *   The files `/etc/secret/username_file` and `/etc/secret/apikey_file` created from the Secret volume (with different filenames as specified in `items`).
    *   The single file `/etc/special/special.txt` created from the specific ConfigMap key using `subPath`.

7.  **Clean Up:**
    ```bash
    kubectl delete pod config-demo-pod
    kubectl delete secret my-app-secret
    kubectl delete configmap my-app-config
    ```

**Congratulations!** You've successfully used ConfigMaps and Secrets to inject configuration and sensitive data into a Pod using environment variables and volume mounts. This decoupling is fundamental to building robust and manageable Kubernetes applications.
