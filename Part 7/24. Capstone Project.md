# Chapter 24: Capstone Project

This capstone project is your opportunity to synthesize and apply the knowledge and skills you've acquired throughout this Kubernetes and Terraform course. You will design, provision, deploy, and manage a non-trivial, production-grade application on Kubernetes, leveraging Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, monitoring, and GitOps principles.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to demonstrate your ability to build and operate a realistic application on Kubernetes, incorporating best practices learned in the course. This involves not just deploying containers but also managing the underlying infrastructure, automating processes, ensuring observability, and considering security.

## Core Requirements

Your project must fulfill the following core requirements:

1.  **Application Design:**
    *   Choose or design an application with at least two distinct microservices (e.g., frontend + backend API, API + worker + database).
    *   The application should have some stateful component (e.g., a database, cache, or message queue) requiring persistent storage.
    *   Define clear APIs for inter-service communication.
2.  **Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform):**
    *   Use Terraform to provision the necessary cloud infrastructure. This **must** include:
        *   Networking resources (VPC, subnets, security groups/firewall rules).
        *   A managed Kubernetes cluster (EKS, GKE, or AKS). Configure node pools appropriately.
        *   Any required external stateful services (e.g., managed database like RDS/Cloud SQL, managed cache like ElastiCache/Memorystore) OR persistent storage infrastructure for self-hosted stateful services.
    *   Organize your Terraform code using modules (either custom local modules or leveraging public modules).
    *   Manage Terraform state using a remote backend with locking.
3.  **Kubernetes Deployment:**
    *   Define all Kubernetes resources declaratively using YAML manifests (Deployments, StatefulSets, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVCs, Ingress, NetworkPolicies, etc.).
    *   Package your application manifests using Helm charts for easier management and parameterization.
    *   Implement appropriate health checks (liveness, readiness probes).
    *   Configure resource requests and limits for your application Pods.
    *   Apply RBAC rules and Pod Security Standards (e.g., Baseline) for security.
4.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Implement a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or similar) that automates:
        *   Building container images for your microservices upon code changes.
        *   Pushing images to a container registry.
        *   Deploying updated application versions to Kubernetes (e.g., using `helm upgrade` or updating manifests for GitOps).
5.  **Observability:**
    *   Deploy a basic monitoring stack (e.g., Prometheus Operator/`kube-prometheus-stack`).
    *   Ensure your application exposes basic metrics (e.g., request count/latency if applicable) or that cluster/node metrics are collected.
    *   Configure basic logging for your application (stdout/stderr captured by Kubernetes, ideally forwarded by a node agent).
6.  **GitOps (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Implement a GitOps workflow using Argo CD or Flux.
    *   Store your Kubernetes manifests (or Helm chart configurations) in a dedicated Git repository.
    *   Configure the GitOps tool to automatically sync changes from the Git repository to your Kubernetes cluster. Your CI pipeline would push manifest changes (e.g., new image tags) to this repository.
7.  **Documentation:**
    *   Provide comprehensive documentation covering:
        *   Application architecture.
        *   Infrastructure setup (how to run Terraform).
        *   Deployment process (how to set up CI/CD or GitOps).
        *   How to access and test the application.
        *   Key design decisions and trade-offs.

## Project Ideas (Suggestions)

Feel free to choose your own project, but here are some ideas:

*   **E-commerce Platform:** Frontend, product catalog API, order processing service, user database.
*   **Social Media Feed:** Web UI, post service, user service, follow service, timeline aggregation, database, cache.
*   **IoT Data Backend:** MQTT broker (e.g., VerneMQ on K8s), data ingestion service, time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB or TimescaleDB on K8s), dashboard/API service.
*   **Simple ML Serving Pipeline:** Model training (as a Job), model storage (object storage), model serving API (Deployment), optional feature store (database/cache).
*   **URL Shortener:** Web frontend, API service for creating/redirecting URLs, database to store mappings.

Choose a project that is complex enough to demonstrate the required concepts but manageable within a reasonable timeframe.

## Deliverables

Your final submission should typically include:

1.  **Source Code:** Application source code for all microservices.
2.  **Containerization Files:** `Dockerfile` for each service.
3.  **Infrastructure Code:** Terraform configuration (`.tf` files) organized into modules.
4.  **Kubernetes Manifests:** YAML files or Helm chart(s) for deploying the application.
5.  **CI/CD Pipeline Definition:** Workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/cicd.yaml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`).
6.  **GitOps Configuration (if used):** Manifest repository structure and Argo CD/Flux configuration files.
7.  **Documentation:** A comprehensive `README.md` or separate document covering the aspects mentioned in the requirements.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on:

*   **Completeness:** Fulfillment of the core requirements.
*   **Correctness:** Proper use of Kubernetes objects, Terraform resources, and CI/CD/GitOps concepts.
*   **Best Practices:** Adherence to security, HA, observability, and IaC best practices discussed in the course.
*   **Automation:** Effective use of CI/CD and/or GitOps for deployment.
*   **Documentation:** Clarity, accuracy, and completeness of the documentation.
*   **Design Choices:** Justification for architectural and tooling decisions.

This capstone project is your chance to build something substantial and demonstrate your readiness to tackle real-world Kubernetes and cloud-native challenges. Good luck!
